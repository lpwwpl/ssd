						Reasons : 

1.  In class Category , 
    (1). replace "vector<Category*> sub_categories" to be "set<Category*> sub_categories;"

     Because the item of sub_categories is unique so using set that elements are unique in set<Category*> sub_categories. So, the code is more readability and performance.

    (2). replace "vector<int> items" to be "set<int> items".
    
    Because the item of category is unique so using set that elements are unique in set<int> items.So, the code is more readability and performance.
	
2.  In class Categories 
    (1). replace "vector<Category*> Container" to be "map<int , Category*> Container".
    
    Reason:
    Simplifies access to individual Category pointer.
    In the overload operator [] function,using the find function to achieve the special Category. So, the code is more readability and performance.

3. In class Group
    (1). replace "vector<Client*> Container" to be "map<string , Client*> Container" 

    Reason:
    Simplifies access to individual Client pointer.
    In the overload operator [] function,using the find function to achieve the special Client. So, the code is more readability and performan

4. In class Client
   (1). replace "vector<int> offerings" to be set<int> offerings.
   (2). replace "vector<int> bids" to be set<int> bids.

   Reason:
   Because the item of offerings is unique so using set that elements are unique in set<int> of offerings.So, the code is more readability and performance.
   Because the item of bids is unique so using set that elements are unique in set<int> of offerings.So, the code is more readability and performance.ce.
